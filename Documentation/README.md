# Endpoints

Data in the app is gathered from four main endpoints on the Shuttle Tracker
website:  
```
shuttles.rpi.edu/vehicles
                /routes
                /stops
                /updates
```
Each endpoint stores JSON data, the entries of which are summarized below.

## History
There is an additional `/history` endpoint that stores entries of all the
update batches received for the last 30 days. The iOS app currently doesn't
utilize historical data at all.


# Data Parsing

There are four classes that we use to represent data from endpoints: Vehicle,
Route, Stop, and Update, as well as Point for representing pairs of latitude
and longitude values. These four classes each have static init functions that
are used to fetch and initialize data from the corresponding endpoint. For
routes and stops, however, data is cached after being initialized and will not
be fetched again until the cached data is deleted. (TODO: check for new data)
```
Vehicle ---> initVehicles() ---------> deserializes the data from the endpoint
                 \                     and populates the vehicles dictionary
                  \                    with objects
                   \                        /
                    ---> fetchVehicles() ---
                   grabs the JSON data from the
                   /vehicles endpoint
```
```
Route ---> initRoutes() ---------------> deserializes the data from either
                 \                       the endpoint or cache and populates
              not cached                 the routes dictionary with objects
                    \                        /
                     ---> fetchVehicles() ---
                   grabs the JSON data from the
                   /routes endpoint and caches it
```
```
Stop ---> initStops() ----------> deserializes the data from either the
               \                  endpoint or the cache and populates the
           not cached             stops dictionary with objects
                 \                     /
                  ---> fetchStops() ---
                grabs the JSON data from the
                /stops ednpoint and caches it
```
```
Update ---> initUpdates(): ----------> deserializes the data from the endpoint,
                  \                    populates the updates list with objects,
                   \                   and propogates the updates to vehicles
                    \                       /
                     ---> fetchUpdates() ---
                    grabs the JSON data from
                    the /updates endpoint
```
The first three of these init fuctions (`initVehicles()`, `initRoutes()`, and
`initStops()`) are called by `initData()` in the ViewController, which is
called only when the view first loads. `initUpdates()` is called every 10
seconds on a timer.

Vehicles are stored in the global `vehicles` dictionary [id:vehicle], routes
are stored in the global `routes` dictionary [id:route], stops are stored in
the global `stops` dictionary [id:stop] as well as in their route, and updates
are stored in the global `updates` list as well as in their vehicle.


# View

Currently, all frontend code exists in the ViewController and a few supporting
classes such as:
- ShuttleAnnotation: An annotation for shuttle markers displayed on the map.
  Stores most of the same data as vehicles.
- ShuttleAnnotationView: overrides the default MapKit annotatation for markers,
  i.e. the red pin. Responsible for resizing, coloring, and rotating shuttle markers.
- RouteView: Routes to be displayed on the map, represented by a polyline.
- StopAnnotation: An annotation for stops to be displayed on the map. Contains
  the static function `initStopViews()`, called in ViewController's `initData()`
  when the view loads.
- ColorPolyline: Overrides the default MapKit polyline and allows it to be
  recolored.
- CenteredTabBar: Overrides the default tab bar controller to change the default
  index.

As for the ViewController itself, the lifecycle is as such:
```
          viewDidLoad()               mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap(mapview)
             /    \                         /        |       \
            /      \                       /         |        \
           /        \                     /          |         \
          /          \             displayRoutes()   |    displayStops()
  initMapView()    initData()                        |
                     /    \                  displayVehicles()
                    /      \                          \
                   /        \                          \
                  /          \                          \
              initStops()     initRouteViews()       timer(10s)
              initRoutes()    initStopViews()            |
              initVehicles()                             |
              initUpdates()                           update()
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                                    initUpdates()
                                                         |
                                                    (new updates?)
                                                         |
                                                     newUpdates()
                                                         
```
The key points in this lifecycle are:
- The order that init functions are called from `initData()` are important, as
  routes depend on stops and updates depend on vehicles.
- `initUpdates()` is called every 10 seconds on a timer, and if the new batch
  of updates differs from the previous, each shuttle annotation on the map is
  updated.


# Notifications

There are two types of notifications supported by the app: nearby notifications
and scheduled notifications. Both of these are dispatched via static functions
in the NotificationHandler, `handleScheduledNotifications()` for scheduled
notifications and  `handleNearbyNotifications()` for nearby notifications.
These functions are called from `update()` on a 10 second timer in the view:
```
                  displayVehicles()
                          |
                          |
                      timer(10s)
                          |
                          |
                       update()
                       /     \
                      /       \
                     /         \
                    /           \
handleNearbyNotifications()  tryScheduledNotifications()
```

## Nearby
A nearby notification is sent whenever a vehicle on a selected route comes
within a certain distance of the user, currently 100 meters for testing
purposes. A "selected route" is a route that is in the `notifyForNearbyIds`
dictionary; the key is the route ID and the value is a counter that is set to
60 after a notification is sent for that route and counts down until it reaches
0, at which point another notification may be sent when a shuttle on that route
enters the notify radius. (TODO: let the user select routes to receive nearby
notifications for through the settings panel)

## Scheduled
A scheduled notification is sent 5 minutes beforehand and when the user
should get on the shuttle to arrive at their destination on time. A scheduled
notification is represented by a Trip, an object that stores:
- `start`: The stop that the user wants to get on the shuttle at
- `destination`: The stop that the user wants to get off the shuttle at
- `getOnShuttleAt`: The time that the user should get on the shuttle at in
  order to arrive at their destination on time. The user does not interact with
  this value directly.
- `arriveBy`: The time that the user wants to get off the shuttle at
- `fiveMinuteWarning`: Whether or not the user has been given the "get on the
  shuttle in 5 minutes" notification for this trip

Trips are displayed and scheduled through the settings panel (in progress).
Here's how it works:
1. The user selects a start, a destination, and an arrival time through the
   settings panel
2. The schedule data is iterated through to find the closest time *before or
   equal to* the selected arrival time that a shuttle on a route containing
   both the start and destination reaches the destination. If no route exists
   that contains both the start and destination, or a similar error occurs, the
   user should be alerted and the trip should not be scheduled.
3. Backtrack through the schedule data to find when the shuttle reaching at the
   destination near the arrival time reaches the start before that. Set
   `getOnShuttleAt` accordingly.
4. Create the trip, store it in `notifyForTrips`, and display it in the
   settings panel. The time on the trip will be checked every 10 seconds from
   `handleScheduledNotifications()` until both the five minute warning and
   the precise notification have been sent, at which point the trip will be removed
   from the list and will no longer be displayed in the settings panel.
