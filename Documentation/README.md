# Endpoints

Data in the app is gathered from four main endpoints on the Shuttle Tracker
website:  
```
shuttles.rpi.edu/vehicles
                /routes
                /stops
                /updates
```
Each endpoint stores JSON data, the entries of which are summarized below.

## Vehicles
```

  "enabled": true,
  "tracker_id": "1831394663"
}
```
`id`: The id of the vehicle, from 1 to 11  
`name`: The name of the vehicle (ex. `Bus 95` or `Van 87`)

`route_id`: The id of the route the vehicle is on  

## History
There is an additional `/history` endpoint that stores entries of all the
update batches received for the last 30 days. The iOS app currently doesn't
utilize historical data at all.


# Data Parsing

There are four classes that we use to represent data from endpoints: Vehicle,
Route, Stop, and Update, as well as Point for representing pairs of latitude
and longitude values. These four classes each have static init functions that
are used to fetch and initialize data from the corresponding endpoint. For
routes and stops, however, data is cached after being initialized and will not
be fetched again until the cached data is deleted. (TODO: check for new data)
```
Vehicle ---> initVehicles() ---------> deserializes the data from the endpoint
                 \                     and populates the vehicles dictionary
                  \                    with objects
                   \                        /
                    ---> fetchVehicles() ---
                   grabs the JSON data from the
                   /vehicles endpoint
```
```
Route ---> initRoutes() ---------------> deserializes the data from either
                 \                       the endpoint or cache and populates
              not cached                 the routes dictionary with objects
                    \                        /
                     ---> fetchVehicles() ---
                   grabs the JSON data from the
                   /routes endpoint and caches it
```
```
Stop ---> initStops() ----------> deserializes the data from either the
               \                  endpoint or the cache and populates the
           not cached             stops dictionary with objects
                 \                     /
                  ---> fetchStops() ---
                grabs the JSON data from the
                /stops ednpoint and caches it
```
```
Update ---> initUpdates(): ----------> deserializes the data from the endpoint,
                  \                    populates the updates list with objects,
                   \                   and propogates the updates to vehicles
                    \                       /
                     ---> fetchUpdates() ---
                    grabs the JSON data from
                    the /updates endpoint
```
The first three of these init fuctions (`initVehicles()`, `initRoutes()`, and
`initStops()`) are called by `initData()` in the ViewController, which is
called only when the view first loads. `initUpdates()` is called every 10
seconds on a timer.

Vehicles are stored in the global `vehicles` dictionary [id:vehicle], routes
are stored in the global `routes` dictionary [id:route], stops are stored in
the global `stops` dictionary [id:stop] as well as in their route, and updates
are stored in the global `updates` list as well as in their vehicle.


# View

Currently, all frontend code exists in the ViewController and a few supporting
classes such as:
- Shuttle: An annotation for shuttle markers displayed on the map. Stores most
  of the same data as vehicles.
- ShuttleArrow: overrides the default MapKit annotatation for markers, i.e. the
  red pin. Responsible for resizing, coloring, and rotating shuttle markers.
- RouteView: Routes to be displayed on the map, represented by a polyline.
- StopView: An annotation for stops to be displayed on the map. Contains the
  static function `initStopViews()`, called in ViewController's `initData()`
  when the view loads.
- CustomPolyline: Overrides the default MapKit polyline and allows it to be
  recolored.
- CustomTabBar: Overrides the default tab bar controller to change the default
  index.

As for the ViewController itself, the lifecycle is as such:
```
          viewDidLoad()               mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap(mapview)
             /    \                         /        |       \
            /      \                       /         |        \
           /        \                     /          |         \
          /          \             displayRoutes()   |    displayStops()
  initMapView()    initData()                        |
                     /    \                  displayVehicles()
                    /      \                          \
                   /        \                          \
                  /          \                          \
              initStops()     initRouteViews()       timer(10s)
              initRoutes()    initStopViews()            |
              initVehicles()                             |
              initUpdates()                           update()
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                                    initUpdates()
                                                         |
                                                    (new updates?)
                                                         |
                                                     newUpdates()
                                                         
```
The key points in this lifecycle are:
- The order that init functions are called from `initData()` are important, as
  routes depend on stops and updates depend on vehicles.
- `initUpdates()` is called every 10 seconds on a timer, and if the new batch
  of updates differs from the previous, each shuttle annotation on the map is
  updated.


# Notifications

There are two types of notifications supported by the app: scheduled
notifications and nearby notifications.
