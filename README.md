# iShuttleTracker

A native iOS port of the RPI Shuttle Tracker web app (shuttles.rpi.edu) that
aims to add functionality past what the web app is able to offer, such as
smooth shuttle movement and precise ETAs, notifications for nearby shuttles
and scheduled trips, dynamic schedule display, and a settings panel to toggle
views.

## Summer 2019 Accomplishments
- [x] Add a UI to schedule trips through for scheduled notifications
- [x] Make nearby notifications more user-friendly in the information they
      provide
- [x] Look into keeping track of nearby shuttles and sending notifications when
      the app is in the background (didn't turn out to be feasible)
- [x] Write an ETA algorithm to make predictions on when shuttles will reach
      destinations and display these on stop annotations
- [x] Look into ways to improve the shuttle prediction algorithm
- [x] Automatically center map on all active routes
- [x] Color shuttle markers dynamically based on the route they are on
- [x] Update app icon to match the Shuttle Tracker color scheme and add it to
      the loading screen
- [x] Refactor and reorganize the project
- [x] Write detailed documentation with all the information one needs to get
      started

## Spring 2019 Accomplishments
- [x] Rewrite frontend to be dynamic (i.e. infinite routes and vehicles)
- [x] Update shuttle markers with proper rotation
- [x] Arrow shuttle icons in direction of movement
- [x] Location/stop descriptions
- [x] Settings panel front-end
- [x] Improved and tested shuttle prediction algorithm
- [x] Finished backend for nearby notifications
- [x] Made significant progress on scheduled notifications backend
- [x] Switch from MapBox to MapKit
- [x] Look into Cocoapods or alternatives to manage packages better
- [x] Sideload onto an iOS device for testing
- [x] 100% useable as an alternative to the web app

## Fall 2018 Accomplishments
- [x] Fetch, parse, and cache all relevant data from the web app
- [x] Display baseline information on frontend
- [x] Toggle route views
- [x] Early attempt at shuttle prediction algorithm
- [x] Added a blank view for schedule display
- [x] Test various frameworks for map and schedule display
